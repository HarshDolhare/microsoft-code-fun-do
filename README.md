#After the disaster has occured:
We would like to make an app in which people will continously get weather report , also during the situation of a flood, people 
will have the information of nearby places where food will be available, people can call out for help if they are facing
some problem, so that any nearby authority (relief camp) or for that matter any citizen willing to help and has a proper mode
of transport can provide support. 
If a particular person is trapped in a flood he or she can inform his or her exact location so that nearby areas or locality
which are currently not affected may be well informed and thus can take preventive measures to save their own as well as people
residing nearby lives.
Also using global positioning system technology the app will be integrated with google maps so that it contains the
information of the nearby relief camps and will guide affected people towards it.

#Before the disaster:
Suppose that there is some area in which flood is predicted in next few hours and that area needs to be evacuated.
Peaple can enter their location and where they want to go. People with proper mode of tranport can also enter where they are heading and how many other people they can take with themselves.
